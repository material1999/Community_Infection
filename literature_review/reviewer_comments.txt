This article addresses the influence maximization problem in social networks and community detection, two classical problems that have been extensively studied in recent years.

Although the topic remains relevant, the proposed approach does not appear to offer substantial added value to the existing literature. Numerous algorithms already support various influence diffusion models and can be applied to community detection problems, heuristics-based centrality measures, among other applications. The novelty of the contribution is not clearly established.

This concern is reinforced by the fact that the bibliography is significantly outdated, making it difficult to justify the originality of the work. This is evident in that only three of the cited works are from the past five years, and the main survey referenced is "Li et al. (2018)", despite the existence of several more recent surveys on this topic. Moreover, Section 2.2.2 is very brief and fails to mention the extensive body of literature on approximate solutions to the influence maximization problem, including greedy algorithms, heuristics, community-based approaches, and metaheuristics (the latter having shown particularly strong results).

There are also issues regarding formalism. The diffusion models are described almost entirely in natural language, and the few mathematical notations that are introduced are not fully defined. For instance, the notation  N_v^+ (the inbound neighborhood of node v) is not explicitly defined. Furthermore, in the description of the "only-listen-once model," the sentence "the first active neighboring node of  n" does not formally make clear how this first node is selected from the initial activation set (i.e., the seed).
This same lack of formalism hampers the clarity of other statements. For example, in line 8, it is stated that "the weighted of an edge directed from node v to w is the approximate probability of w being activated by the influence process starting from v." However, under the Linear Threshold model, edge weights do not represent activation probabilities (as they do in the Independent Cascade model), but the contribution of a neighboring node to collectively help surpass the threshold of the target node.

In terms of the paper structure, Section 3, titled "Methodology," does not present a methodology per se, but rather a proposed solution.

Regarding the experimentation with real-world networks, it is unclear why SNAP networks requiring randomly generated weights were chosen, considering that SNAP already provides weighted networks.

Regarding minor aspects, a thorough revision of the writing and style is recommended. Several typos have been identified that should be corrected. A (very incomplete) list of observations includes:
- p.3: Style issues in the in-paragraph enumeration.
- p.7: Parenthesis issue in line 3 of Algorithm 1.
- p.7: "the the".
- In general: Citation format, e.g., "in Wasserman and Faust (1994)" instead of "in (Wasserman and Faust, 1994)", or "Kóvacs et al. (2010) showed..." instead of "Kóvacs et al. (Kóvacs et al., 2010) showed..."

Comments:

This manuscript  introduces a generalized framework that bridges community detection and influence maximization. By simulating influence propagation to construct weighted graphs, it identifies overlapping communities through iterative agglomerative clustering and prioritizes nodes with high community overlap to narrow the search space of greedy algorithms, significantly reducing computational costs while preserving performance. This approach generalizes across influence models (e.g., IC, LT) and demonstrates scalability on both synthetic and real-world networks. However, the study still has the following problems.

1. Code Availability and experiments replicability: the authors must provide links to the implementation of the proposed algorithm and datasets in a public repository system (GitHub, GitLab...). The same for the implementation of competitor algorithms, tools used to generate synthetic networks and procedures to evaluate the obtained results.
3. The methodology description lacks clarity, particularly for Algorithms 2 and 3. We suggest adding mathematical formulas or formal descriptions to improve rigor and reproducibility.
4. How is the parameter κ_max (maximum community size) in Algorithm 3 determined? What is its impact on community detection results? A theoretical or empirical justification is missing.
5. For artificial datasets, the rationale for setting node weights within the range 0.05–0.1 is not explained. Are these values empirically or theoretically derived?
6. The manuscript omits time complexity analysis for the proposed algorithms, which is critical for evaluating scalability.
7. Comparisons with state-of-the-art influence maximization algorithms are lacking, weakening the claim of superiority.
8. The evaluation uses only three real-world datasets, which is insufficient to demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness across diverse network types.
