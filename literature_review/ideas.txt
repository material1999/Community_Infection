##### LITERATURE REVIEW #####

The existing literature lacks a comprehensive overview of the general applicability of influence maximization methods to different diffusion models other than the well-known Independent Cascade and Linear Threshold models. The main contribution of this paper is our proposed framework that is capable of approximating the influence maximization problem for any diffusion model. We achieve this goal by creating an influence graph as the first step of our pipeline by simulating influence spread on the original input network. From this point onwards, the algorithm is general in a way that the influence model is not used in any upcoming step. We argue that the characteristics of both the diffusion model and the input network can be encapsulated in the emerging influence graph.



##### TESTING #####

our networks:
- Cit-HepPh
- soc-Epinions1
- Email-EuAll

proposed networks to try:
- wiki-Vote
- ego-Facebook (make it directed in both ways)

our edge weights:
- between 0 and 0.2 with uniform distribution

edge weights in papers:
- weighted cascade model/policy (each incoming edge: 1/indegree)
- trivalency model (drawn uniformly at random from a small set of constants eg. {0.1, 0.01, 0.001})
