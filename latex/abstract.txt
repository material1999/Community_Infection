The influence maximization problem aims to find a set of nodes from which the maximum expected value of influenced nodes is generated through a given influence process. Enhancing influence maximization with community detection has become an important topic in recent years. However, most of the existing approaches focus on a few specific infection models, such as the Independent Cascade Model. In this paper, we propose a general algorithm that can be combined with a large variety of infection models: it can use any influence model as its input, and its output can narrow down the search space of the influence maximization problem. This is done by sorting nodes based on their community roles, and selecting nodes with the best values as candidates to maximize influence value. We show the generality and efficiency of our algorithm on artificial and real-life benchmark graphs for the Independent Cascade, Linear Threshold, Only-Listen-Once and Decreasing Cascade influence models.
