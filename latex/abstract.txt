In recent years, many papers have focused on community detection and influence spread or maximization in social networks. The influence maximization problem involves determining a set of k nodes from which the maximum expected value of influenced nodes is generated through a given influence process. Our intuition was that in social networks, entities with important community roles might also be crucial when dealing with the influence maximization problem. However, most of the approaches focus on specific models and their unique attributes. Our goal was to design an algorithm that is generalized in a way that it is independent of these specialties. We have developed a general community detection method that can use any influence model as its input, and based on the found communities, it can narrow down the search space of the influence maximization problem. We only select nodes from the best candidates sorted by their community roles and try to maximize the expected final influence value. With our proof of concept approach, we show the efficiency of our algorithm on small benchmark graphs and three popular influence models, namely the Independent Cascade, Linear Threshold and Only-Listen-Once models.
